# Arrow Functions & Map/Reduce Practice

Instructions:

Put your names at the top of `index.js`.

Choose one person to be the driver and one person to be the navigator. The driver should share their screen and type in the code.

Click on `part1.js` and complete the following steps:

Re-write the greet function using arrow notation.
Complete the transform_list function according to the instructions.

When you are done, run your code. It should print out:

```
['Hello, Dani!', 'Hello, Meredith!', 'Hello, Alan!', 'Hello, Jess!']
```

Switch partners before going on to Part 2 in `part2.js` and complete the following steps:

Re-write the `add` and `multiply` functions using arrow notation.
Complete the `combine_list` function according to the instructions.

When you are done, it should print out the value of 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15). Try calling combine_list again and passing in the multiply function instead of the add function. What happens?

Go over the solutions with your partner to check your work.

When you're done, hit the "Submit" button.
